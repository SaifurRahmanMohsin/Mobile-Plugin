# [RESTful-Plugin](https://github.com/SaifurRahmanMohsin/Restful-Plugin) #
Mobile plugin for October CMS

## Introduction ##

This plugin enables you to manage mobile applications. You can add your iOS, Android and other store app listing into the backend. It also lets you monitor individual app installs by adding some code on the client-side (see video or documentation).

Tutorial and demonstration of the plugin [here](http://www.youtube.com/embed/VJOH1x967ag).

[Note: Right now the Android plugin is under development so I have disabled the reserved plugin feature, you can manually create **Android** using Platforms settings directly]

## Features ##
* Add multiple variants and platforms.

## Coming Soon ##
* Dashboard widget to provide app install analytics.
* Maintenance mode features to block variants.
* Add custom fields and track those values.

## Requirements ##

* [RESTful](http://octobercms.com/plugin/mohsin-rest) plugin
